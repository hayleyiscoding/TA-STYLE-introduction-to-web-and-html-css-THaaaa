        <p>Louisiana's Lake Charles city, littered with storm damage, also was dealing with what the governor said was a chemical fire at a plant in the area Thursday morning, with large plumes of smoke rising in the sky. The fire moved Gov. John Bel Edwards to urge residents to take shelter, turn off air conditioning units and await instructions from officials. Details about precisely what was burning, and whether it related to the storm, weren't immediately available.</p>
